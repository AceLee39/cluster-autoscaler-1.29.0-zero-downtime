# KEP - Balancer 

## Introduction

One of the problems that the users are facing when running Kubernetes deployments is how to 
deploy pods across several domains and keep them balanced and autoscaled at the same time. 
These domains may include:

* Cloud provider zones inside a single region, to ensure that the application is still up and running, even if one of the zones has issues.
* Different types of Kubernetes nodes. These may involve nodes that are spot/preemptible, or of different machine families. 

A single Kubernetes deployment may either leave the placement entirely up to the scheduler 
(most likely leading to something not entirely desired, like all pods going to a single domain) or 
focus on a single domain (thus not achieving the goal of being in two or more domains). 

PodTopologySpreading solves the problem a bit, but not completely. It allows only even spreading 
and once the deployment gets skewed it doesnâ€™t do anything to rebalance. Pod topology spreading 
(with skew and/or ScheduleAnyway flag) is also just a hint, if skewed placement is available and 
allowed then Cluster Autoscaler is not triggered and the user ends up with a skewed deployment. 
A user could specify a strict pod topolog spreading but then, in case of problems the deployment
would not move its pods to the domains that are available. The growth of the deployment would also 
be totally blocked as the available domains would be too much skewed.

Thus, if full flexibility is needed, the only option is to have multiple deployments, targeting 
different domains. This setup however creates one big problem. How to consistently autoscale multiple 
deployments? The simplest idea - having multiple HPAs is not stable, due to different loads, race 
conditions or so, some domains may grow while the others are shrunk. As HPAs and deployments are 
not connected anyhow, the skewed setup will not fix itself automatically. It may eventually come to 
a semi-balanced state but it is not guaranteed. 


Thus there is a need for some component that will:

* Keep multiple deployments aligned. For example it may keep an equal ratio between the number of
pods in one deployment and the other. Or put everything to the first and overflow to the second and so on.
* React to individual deployment problems should it be zone outage or lack of spot/preemptible vms. 
* Actively try to rebalance and get to the desired layout.
* Allow to autoscale all deployments with a single target, while maintaining the placement policy.

## Balancer 

Balancer is a stand-alone controller, living in userspace (or in control plane, if needed) exposing 
a CRD API object, also called Balancer. Each balancer object has pointers to multiple deployments 
or other pod-controlling objects that expose the Scale subresource. Balancer periodically checks 
the number of running and problematic pods inside each of the targets, compares it with the desired 
number of replicas, constraints and policies and adjusts the number of replicas on the targets, 
should some of them run too many or too few of them. To allow being an HPA target Balancer itself
exposes the Scale subresource.

## Balancer API

```go
// Balancer is an object used to automatically keep the desired number of
// replicas (pods) distributed among the specified set of targets (deployments
// or other objects that expose the Scale subresource).
type Balancer struct {
   metav1.TypeMeta

// BalancerSpec is the specification of the Balancer behavior.
type BalancerSpec struct {
   // Targets is a list of targets between which Balancer tries to distribute
   // replicas.

   // Replicas is the number of pods that should be distributed among the
   // declared targets according to the specified policy.
   Replicas int32
   // Selector that groups the pods from all targets together (and only those).
   // Ideally it should match the selector used by the Service built on top of the
   // Balancer. All pods selectable by targets' selector must match to this selector,
   // however target's selector don't have to be a superset of this one (although
   // it is recommended).
   Selector metav1.LabelSelector
   // Policy defines how the balancer should distribute replicas among targets.
   Policy BalancerPolicy
}
 
// BalancerTarget is the declaration of one of the targets between which the balancer
// tries to distribute replicas.

   // desired number of replicas for Balancer is lower.
   // +optional

type PriorityPolicy struct {

type ProportionalPolicy struct {
   // TargetProportions is a map from Balancer targets names to rates. Replicas are

   // and the desired replica share is minimized. Once a target reaches maxReplicas
   // it is removed from the calculations and replicas are distributed with
   // the updated proportions. MinReplicas is guaranteed for a target, irrespective
   // of the total Balancer's replica count, proportions or the presence in the map.

// that failed to start within the specified time period.
type Fallback struct {
